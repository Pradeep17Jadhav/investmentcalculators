A **credit score** is a three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness and financial behavior. Banks, NBFCs, and other lenders use it to determine your eligibility for loans, credit cards, and other financial products. A high credit score opens doors to better interest rates and financial opportunities, while a low score can limit access to credit.

## **How is a Credit Score Calculated?**

Credit scores, such as **CIBIL, Experian, Equifax, and CRIF High Mark**, range from **300 to 900**. The higher the score, the better your creditworthiness. These scores are calculated based on the following factors:

- **Payment History (35%)** – Timely repayments improve scores, while missed or late payments hurt them.
- **Credit Utilization (30%)** – The percentage of used credit versus the total limit. Lower utilization (less than 30%) is ideal.
- **Credit Age (15%)** – Older credit accounts contribute positively.
- **Credit Mix (10%)** – A balance of secured (home loans) and unsecured (credit cards) credit helps.
- **New Credit Inquiries (10%)** – Frequent loan applications reduce scores temporarily.

## **Credit Score Ranges and Their Impact**

**750 – 900 (Excellent):** Quick loan approvals, low interest rates.  
**650 – 749 (Good):** Decent approval chances, moderate interest rates.  
**550 – 649 (Fair):** Higher interest rates, limited loan options.  
**Below 550 (Poor):** High chances of loan rejection or strict conditions.
