## **Common Mistakes to Avoid While Buying Term Insurance**

Many people make costly mistakes when purchasing term insurance. Here’s what you should watch out for:

### **1. Choosing Insufficient Coverage**

Many people underestimate their financial needs and buy a lower sum assured. Always consider inflation, lifestyle expenses, and future liabilities before deciding on a coverage amount.

### **2. Ignoring Riders and Add-ons**

Riders such as critical illness cover, accidental death benefits, and waiver of premium can significantly enhance your policy. Don’t ignore these add-ons if they fit your needs.

### **3. Not Disclosing Medical History**

Hiding pre-existing diseases or lifestyle habits like smoking or drinking can lead to claim rejection. Always provide accurate information to avoid disputes later.

### **4. Buying a Shorter Policy Tenure**

Term insurance should ideally cover you until your retirement (60-65 years). Avoid choosing a shorter policy tenure that expires too soon.

### **5. Not Reviewing the Claim Settlement Ratio**

Always check the insurer’s claim settlement ratio (CSR). A higher CSR (above 95%) indicates a better track record of claim approvals.

### **6. Delaying the Purchase**

Buying term insurance at a younger age (in your 20s or early 30s) ensures lower premiums. Delaying the purchase increases your premium costs significantly.

### **7. Not Comparing Policies**

Don’t buy the first policy you come across. Compare different plans, coverage benefits, and premiums before making a decision.
